## Inspiration 





We were inspired by our own life - every day we wake up and wonder: what am I going to wear today? 

This can even be more complicated in certain situations, especially when we're late, tired, or are going on an important date or job interview.

...Enter: QuickStyler! 

## How does QuickStyler help you every day?

**Personalized outfit suggestions** directly from your wardrobe!
**Tags** help sort clothes by **mood**, **type of clothing**, and **colour schemes**!
Connections to **calendar**, **weather** to get **event and temperature-based recommendations**!

*Note: A lot of these features are only implemented in part, given the time constraints*

## How we built it

We built it with HTML, JS, CSS, Json and Bootstrap! 

## Challenges we ran into 

Our biggest problem was time. We were too ambitious and we couldn't finish all the desired features, although for a Hackathon this is very much expected :-)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

We really strived in the project design part of the Hackathon. We managed to have a strong consensus on what we wanted to develop for the demo and on the idea the app would incorporate in the short term and in the long term. It all came down to using what we learn in classes like UI design and software engineering. We used the team work skills we built for more than 2 years by working on projects together as undergrads!

We are really proud of what we built, given the time we had.

## What we learned 

We learned a lot about web programming, especially managing time and work for 4 people with different skillsets. We learned to communicate efficiently during long work hours and in situations of fatigue. 

## What's next for Quick Styler 
* **Graph algorithms to help create smart relationships between pieces of clothing** - Machine learning + data collection refine ad suggestions based on user activity details
* **Share clothing recommendations & outfits** to your friends and to your feed
* **Interact with your connections** through a fashion lens
* **Follow celebrities & influencers' style choices** and copy them through the tap of a finger
