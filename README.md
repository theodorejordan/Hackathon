## Inspiration 





We were inspired by our own life. Every day we wake up and wonder : what am I going to wear today? This question can get complicated in certain situations: we can be late or we can be tired. The tool aims to simplify our lives! 



## What it does 

This mobile website allows you to create and visualize a look made with your clothes! All the clothes are label with tags. Tags allow you to better categorize clothes and create outfits that work together. You can do a quizz that will manage the tags for you or select them manually.  

## How we built it

We built it with HTML, javascript, css, json and Bootstrap!  

## Challenges we ran into Our biggest problem was time.

 We were too ambitious and we couldn't finish all the desired features. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

We really strived in the project design part of the Hackathon. We managed to have a strong consensus on what we wanted to develop for the demo and on the idea the app would incorporate in the short term and in the long term. It all came down to using what we learn in classes like Human-Computer Interface and software engineering. We used the team work skills we built for more than 2 years by working on projects in our studies. We are really proud of what we built, given the time we had. 

## What we learned 

We learned a lot about web programming, especially managing time and work for 4 persons with different skillsets. We learned to communicate efficiently during long work hours and in situations of fatigue.
